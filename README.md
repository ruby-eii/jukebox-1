# Jukebox (day 1)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-uniovi/jukebox-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-uniovi/jukebox-cli)

This project contains the exercises for the ruby@Uniovi workshop (day 1). Slides with some extra information can be found on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/dgsuarez/ruby-basics)

ruby@uniovi is a 2-day workshop which will be held in the University of Oviedo (Spain), from 4th to 6th March 2015.

## Play with it!

Our recommended way to play with this sample app is through ruby@uniovi's development environment.

Refer to http://github.com/ruby-uniovi/rubyeii for installation instructions.

You'll happily have a brand-new Vagrant box with all the workshop material already packed ;)

## Roadmap / Support

This software has been created exclusively for educational purposes.

It's still under active development, so use it at your own perice and be happy about sharing that with us! :)
